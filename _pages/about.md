Hi, I am Gong Jinqi. Currently I am a senior student studying at the University of Macau majoring in Statistics and Data Science in the Mathematics Department, Faculty of Science and Technology. My research interests include machine learning, information retrieval, data analysis, and mathematical modeling.

I was a visiting student at UC Berkeley in Spring 2023.
