Education
======
* M.S. in Analytics, University of Southern California, 2026 (Expected)
  * Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Viterbi School of Engineering
* B.S. in Mathematics with Specialization in Statistics and Data Science, University of Macau, 2024
  * Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Technology

Experience
======
* _Research Assistant_, Tsinghua University
  * Summer 2023
  * Information Retrieval Lab at Tsinghua University (THUIR)
  * Research area: Information Retrieval, Recommendation System, Neural Network, Deep Learning, Large Language Model
  * Supervisor: Ma Shaoping, Professor
 
* _Visiting Student_, University of California, Berkeley
  * Spring 2023
  * Program: Berkeley Global Access (BGA)

Research
======
* Stock Model Analysis and Investment Strategy Based on Chinese Characteristics Valuation System
  * "Greater Bay Area Cup" Financial Mathematical Modeling Competition
  * Silver Medal, First Prize (Top 0.17%)
  * _Description_. By implementing machine learning algorithms and classification models, we constructed five key characteristic
indicators of the Chinese Characteristics Stock Valuation (CCV) system, quantitatively described and classified the
characteristics of CCV stocks, and developed short-term and long-term investment portfolios with considerable returns.

* Double Correction Framework for Denoising Recommendation
  * Paper accepted by the ACM SIGKDD Conference 2024
  * At Tsinghua University
  * _Description_. Existing loss-based approaches to discard noisy labels have two limitations: the loss is unstable due to random
initialization of parameters, and the discard may introduce inconsistencies in the training and testing spaces. A double correction
framework for denoising recommendation is proposed to solve the problems.

* The Art of Data Augmentation and Parameter Expansion in Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  * Supervisor: Zhi Liu, Professor
  * At University of Macau
  * _Description_. We summarize recent developments in integrating Data Augmentation and Parameter Expansion techniques to
enhance MCMC efficiency, and precisely define the Parameter Expansion Data Augmentation (PX-DA) algorithm, which refines
the traditional methods and exhibits improved convergence properties, as supported by theoretical analysis and extensive
simulations, and contributes to advancing Bayesian methods, providing a more robust framework for handling complex models.

* Matrix Functions with Chebyshev Polynomials
  * At University of California, Berkeley
  * _Description_. Under the guidance of Prof. Michael Lindsey, more general functions of matrices can be constructed as limits of
polynomials. By approximating general functions with Chebyshev polynomials, one can derive efficient algorithms for performing
mat-vecs easily. Diverse experiments were demonstrated by Matlab to prove the efficiency of this method.
